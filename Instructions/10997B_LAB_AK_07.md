# Lab: Managing Office 365 ProPlus installations

## Exercise 1: Preparing Office 365 ProPlus installations

#### Task 1: Download the Office 365 Deployment Tool

1. On  **LON-CL1**, on the taskbar, click  **File Explorer**.

2. In  **File Explorer**, expand  **This PC**, and then click the  **Local Disk (C:)** in the left navigation pane.

3. In  **File Explorer**, click the  **Home** tab, and then click **New Folder**.

4. Type  **Office16**, and then press Enter.

7. In the  **File Sharing** dialog box, click **Done**.

8. From the taskbar, open the  **Microsoft Edge** browser.

9. In the address bar, type  [**https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=49117**](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=49117), and then press Enter.

10. On the  **Office Deployment Tool** page, expand **Details**,  **System Requirements**, and  **Install Instructions**.

11. Read and familiarize yourself with each section. You can mark this page as a favorite to refer to later.

12. Click  **Download** and notice the information bar at the bottom of the browser.

13. Click  **Save**, and once the download is completed, click  **Run**.

14. In the  **User Account Control** dialog box, click **Yes**.

15. Accept the license agreement and click  **Continue**.

16. Browse to the  **Office16** folder on **This PC's C: drive**.

17. Click  **OK**. You should see that the files were extracted successfully. Click  **OK**.

18. Navigate to the  **Office16** folder with **File Explorer**. You should see two files named  **configuration-Office365-x*xx*** and one named **setup**.



#### Task 2: Modify an Office 365 ProPlus installation

1. In this step, you will back up the Office 16 **configuration-Office365-x86.xml** file and then open it so that you can edit it in the next step. To do this, on LON-CL1, perform the following steps:  
In  **File Explorer**, in Office16 folder, right-click  **configuration-Office365-x86.xml**, and then click  **Copy**. Right click in an empty area, and then click  **Paste**.

2. Click and right-click the  **configuration-Office365-x86.xml** file, click **Open with**, and then click  **Notepad**.

3. In  **Notepad**, edit the first  "**&lt;Add**" line after "**&lt;Configuration&gt;**" to read:

```xml
<Add SourcePath="\\LON-CL1\Office16\" OfficeClientEdition="32" Channel="Monthly">
```

4. In  **Notepad**, remove all the remaining **comment codes** in the lines that start with:  "**&lt;!--**" and end with "**--&gt;**" so each line of code begins with a "**&lt;**" (less-than symbol).

>**Note:** leave the comment codes on the instructions paragraph at the top of the file (above &lt;Configuration&gt;), or delete the paragraph entirely.

5. Comment out Microsoft Visio with the  "**&lt;!--**" and "**--&gt;**" codes to make the download quicker,  
**by replacing this code:**

```xml
  </Product>
  <Product ID="VisioProRetail">
    <Language ID="en-us" />
  <Product>
```

**with this code:**

```xml
  </Product>
<!--
  <Product ID="VisioProRetail">
    <Language ID="en-us" />
  </Product>
-->
```

6. The entire file beginning with "**&lt;Configuration&gt;**"  
**should look like this:**

```xml
<Configuration>

 <Add SourcePath= "\\LON-CL1\Office16" OfficeClientEdition="32" Channel="Monthly">
    <Product ID="O365ProPlusRetail">
     <Language ID="en-us" />
   </Product>
<!-- 
  <Product ID="VisioProRetail">
    <Language ID="en-us" />
  </Product>
-->
  </Add>

<Updates Enabled="TRUE" Channel="Monthly" />

<Display Level="None" AcceptEULA="TRUE" />

<Property Name="AUTOACTIVATE" Value="1" />

</Configuration>
```

7. Save the file as  **AdatumConfiguration.xml**, and then close  **Notepad**.

8. Switch to  **File Explorer** (you should still be in the **Office16** folder), press Shift, right-click any white space below the file list, and then click **Open command window here**.

9. At the command prompt, type the following command, and then press Enter:

```
Setup /?
```

10. Note the  **Office Deployment Tool** command-line options.

11. At the command prompt, type the following command, and then press Enter:

```
setup.exe /download \\LON-CL1\Office16\AdatumConfiguration.xml
```

12. In the  **User Account Control** window, if it appears, click **Yes**.

13. The download will take several minutes to complete.

14. Switch to  **File Explorer**, and verify that the download has started in the  **Office16** folder. The existence of the **Office** folder verifies this. You can continue with the next task and leave the download in the background.


>  **Result**: You will have downloaded a copy of the Microsoft Office 365 ProPlus install for managed deployment to a shared folder. You will also have downloaded and installed the Office Deployment Tool on the same machine.
