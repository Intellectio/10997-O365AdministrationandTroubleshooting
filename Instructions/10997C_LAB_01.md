# Lab: Office 365 services overview

### Scenario

 As one of the most experienced IT administrators at A. Datum Corporation, you are responsible for Office 365 management. To start, you want to provision your Office 365 tenant so that you can evaluate some administrative tasks.


### Objectives

 After completing this lab, you will be able to:

- Set up an Office 365 tenant.

- Configure tenant options.

>  **Note:** The lab steps for this course change frequently due to updates to Office 365. Microsoft Learning updates the lab steps frequently, so they are not available in this manual. Your instructor will provide you with the lab documentation.

### Lab setup

 Estimated time: 45 minutes

Virtual machines:  **MT17B-WS2016-NAT**,  **10997C-LON-DC1**, and  **10997C-LON-CL1**

 User name:  **Adatum\\Administrator**

 Password:  **Pa55w.rd**

For this lab, you need to use the available virtual machine environment. Before you begin the lab, if necessary, you must complete the following steps:

1. On the host computer, click  **Start**, point to  **Administrative Tools**, and then click  **Hyper-V Manager**.

2. In Hyper-V Manager, click  **MT17B-WS2016-NAT**, and then, in the  **Actions** pane, click **Start**.

3. In the  **Actions** pane, click **Connect**. Wait until the virtual machine starts.

4. In Hyper-V Manager, click  **10997C-LON-DC1**, and then, in the  **Actions** pane, click **Start**.

5. In the  **Actions** pane, click **Connect**. Wait until the virtual machine starts.

6. Sign in by using the following credentials:

  - User name:  **Administrator**

  - Password:  **Pa55w.rd**

  - Domain:  **Adatum**

7. Repeat steps 4 and 5 on  **10997C-LON-CL1**, and then sign in by using the following credentials:

  - User name:  **Holly**

  - Password:  **Pa55w.rd**

  - Domain:  **Adatum**


 In all tasks:

- Where you see references to  **Adatum*yyxxxxx*.onmicrosoft.com**, replace  ***yyxxxxx*** with your unique Adatum number that you choose in Lab 1 - Exercise 1, Task 1. In all tasks, where you see references to ***Customdomainname.hostdomain.com*** replace this string with your custom domain name provided by your lab hosting provider.



## Exercise 1: Setting up an Office 365 lab environment

### Scenario

 The first step in starting the pilot deployment is to configure the Office 365 tenant. You need to create a new tenant using the  **Adatum*yyxxxxx*.onmicrosoft.com** domain name.

>  **Note:** This lab uses a standard Office 365 trial account, not a FastTrack pilot extended tenant account. Also, you need to create an account with a unique name in the form: **Adatum*yyxxxxx*.onmicrosoft.com**. You can use your two primary initials followed by a unique five-digit number. For example, **Adatum*AB12345***. You can also get the name from your lab setup info.

 The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:

1. Create an Office 365 Enterprise E5 trial subscription

2. Verify the health of services



#### Task 1: Create an Office 365 Enterprise E5 trial subscription

   ***Note: By configuring your custom domain name as default domain, all users that you create in your Office 365 tenant will have sign in name and email address on your custom domain name. Only first global admin account that you created during tenant provisioning will still use Adatumyyxxxx.onmicrosoft.com domain name.***



#### Task 4: Verify the health of services

1. Use  **Service health** on the navigation menu on the left to display the **Service health** dashboard.

2. Review any service interruption records and additional information on the  **Incidents** page.

>  **Note:** During Microsoft testing, on rare occasions Office 365 did not create the trial tenant properly. As a result, the tenant did not have all the services available to it. If this happens to you, create a new trial tenant by using a different business email address (a Microsoft account).

3. Close Microsoft Edge.

4. If you receive a prompt, click  **Close all tabs**.


>  **Result**: After completing this exercise, you should have successfully provisioned the Office 365 tenant account for A. Datum Corporation.
